# Ajna: Generalized deep uncertainty for minimal perception on parsimonious robots

Ajna was highlighted on the cover of Science Robotics journal in Aug 2023. The paper can be found [here](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scirobotics.add5139) for free. This work is a collaboration between the University of Maryland, College Park ([PRG-UMD](prg.cs.umd.edu)) and Worcester Polytechnic Institute ([PeAR-WPI](pear.wpi.edu)). Please refer to the [wiki](https://github.com/prgumd/ajna/wiki) for instructions on running the code and some research tips and tricks.

Please check out the video for a description of the approach.

We present an approach to estimate uncertainty of any neural network with a loss function that can be adapted to modify any existing loss function for any class of robotics problems. We showcase the approach's efficacy in flying through gaps, navigating through a static environment, dodging dynamic obstacles and segmenting objects from a scene.
